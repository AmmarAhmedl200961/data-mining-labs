## Featured Labs

### Lab 6: Customer Segmentation Analysis
This lab involves analyzing customer data to segment them based on purchasing behavior and demographics using unsupervised learning techniques. This is vital for businesses looking to tailor their marketing strategies to specific customer groups.

### Lab 9: Ensemble Methods for Sentiment Classification
Focuses on using ensemble learning methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification models. This approach is crucial for developing robust predictive models that are less prone to errors inherent to individual models.

### Lab 11: Clustering with K-means and Agglomerative
Explores the use of K-means and Agglomerative clustering to analyze and group large datasets. This lab highlights the importance of clustering in unsupervised learning to identify natural groupings within data.

### Lab 14: Data Visualization and Clustering Methods
Demonstrates various data visualization techniques alongside clustering methods such as K-Medoid, BIRCH, CHAMELEON, and DBSCAN. Effective visualization helps in understanding the underlying patterns and anomalies in the data, which is critical for any data-driven process.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-mining-labs.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd data-mining-labs
```

Installing
Each notebook is self-contained and most of the work was done in colab, in any case, feel free to open an issue to ask me which lab can have an issue with the installation.



## Usage
Open in Google Colab or any cloud notebook and run the cells in each notebook to see the results and analysis. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters to gain a better understanding of the concepts covered in each lab.
